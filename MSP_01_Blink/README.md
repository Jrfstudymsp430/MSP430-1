Blink
===

Blink is the "Hello World" for hardware. In this experiment we are going to look into create a flashing LED on the MSP430 using a delay function and a simple software pin toggle. In this project we will be using standard C with a few tricks.Below is starting code for the MSP430 and a few things that you'll need to understand. 

lets say in the below example PORT is equal to 0001 as a 4 bit number.

```
example 1: NOT
PORT = ~PORT
     = 1110

example 2: Addition
PORT = PORT + 1000
     = 1001

example 3: Bitwise OR
PORT = PORT | 1100
     = 1101
```
	 
There are many more examples [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operators_in_C_and_C%2B%2B#Compound_assignment_operators)

Starting off code
==
=
``` C
/*  Blink LED example */

#include <msp430g2553.h>

#define PIN0 (0x01 << 0)  //RED Led
#define PIN6 (0x01 << 6)  //GREEN led.

/* * Delay function. **/
delay(unsigned int input) {
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i<input; i++) {
		__delay_cycles(1000); // 1ms aprrox. 
	}
}

int main(void) {
	WDTCTL = WDTPW | WDTHOLD;		// Stop the watch dog timer.
	// Direction of the port. (High means output Low means input)
	P1DIR = (PIN0 + PIN6); // 0100 0001
	// Port output. LEDs are on pin 0 and 6.			
	P1OUT = 0x01; // 0000 0001					

	while(1){

		// Start Code here!

	}
}
```

Once That is Complete Challenge Yourself

Make the two LED's alternate in their blinking.

eg That is, red, green, red, green, etc... 


Make one LED stay on for longer than the other.

eg Red for 1 second, Green for 0.5 second.
