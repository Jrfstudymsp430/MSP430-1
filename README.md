MSP430
======

This is a repo of the MSP430 from basics to something more advanced. 

Each folder is a project, these projects are designed for first year students and people that are starting to learn programming. While my coding skills are not amazing they generally get me by. 

For ease of use and not tied to a operating system, weâ€™re going to use [Energia](http://energia.nu). This allows the user to jump from Windows, OS X and Linux giving us greater flexibility. 

Energia has been designed for the following Micro Controllers:
* LaunchPad with MSP430G2231, MSP430G2452 or MSP430G2553 
* FraunchPad with MSP430FR5739 
* StellarPad with LM4F120H5QR

For this repository, the code will be based around the MSP430G2553 Micro controller.

Thank you.
